# WikiSys Development Rules

This document defines the core development rules and practices for all IT-Enterprise Solutions projects.

## Core Principles

1. **Quality First** - Write clean, maintainable, well-tested code
2. **Security by Design** - Consider security in every decision
3. **Documentation** - Document code, APIs, and architecture
4. **Continuous Improvement** - Refactor and improve regularly

## Project Standards

### Code Quality
- All code must pass linting checks
- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Code review required for all changes
- Follow language-specific style guides

### Version Control
- Use semantic versioning
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep branches short-lived
- Merge frequently

### Deployment

- Test in staging before production
- Maintain rollback capability
- Monitor after deployment

## Communication

- Use issue tracking for tasks
- Regular team sync meetings
- Knowledge sharing sessions
